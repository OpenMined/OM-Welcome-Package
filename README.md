## Who We Are

Before getting started, it's important to understand OpenMined's mission:<br>
To **lower the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technology.**
<br><br>
This means that we want to help **you** by both making your products and research better, **and** protecting you along the way.<br><br>
[**Check out OpenMined's 2020 Roadmap for more about how we plan to make this happen!**](https://github.com/OpenMined/Roadmap)<br><br>
We also want to make sure that OpenMined is a welcoming community to anyone who wants to join. To that end, check out our [**code of conduct**](https://github.com/OpenMined/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for information on how to make sure we continue to be such.

<br><br><br>

## Teams

OpenMined's teams are split into 3 categories: [development](Development-Teams.md), [community](Community-Teams.md), and [research](Research-Teams.md), so there is room for everyone to contribute!

To get started working on these projects, **check out our [tutorials](#tutorials) below.**

<br><br><br>

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Join Slack
The first thing you should do is [join our Slack community](https://slack.openmined.org). This is the best place to ask questions, meet other team members, and stay up to date on what's going on in the community.<br>

Once you have joined the Slack organization, there are many channels that you can join for help and community, including:

- **Community Channels:**  You can introduce yourself and meet other members in the community channels, for instance, *#introductions* or *#com_women-of-om* 
- **Beginner-friendly and Support Channels:** If you haven general questions or need help with specific OpenMined libraries, take a look or post your questions in the *#beginners* or *#support* channels.
- **Topic Based Channels:**  Search for channels by area of interest, for example: *#federated-learning*, *#differential-privacy*, *#healthcare*, *#recommender-systems*
- **Sharing Channels:**  Community channels for sharing interesting papers, job opportunites or laughs, visit *#research-papers*, *#jobs* or *#memes*
- **Education Channels:**  If you'd like to talk to fellow students or ask questions related to the [FREE Privacy and AI Courses](https://courses.openmined.org/) visit the *#courses* channel.
<br>

<br>

### Step 2: Help us get to know you better
By filling out ðŸ‘‰ [this form](https://forms.gle/JFEh2pfdjJLcRyjZA) you can help us help you and leadership have a single place to browse the skills and interests of those new to the community.

<br>

### Step 3: Learning Initiatives

[**The OpenMined Learning Team**](https://blog.openmined.org/announcing-the-openmined-learning-team/) is here to help you get started and work through the materials. To join our community of learners (and any of our cohorts, bootcamps, or study/discussion groups), [join our Slack team](https://slack.openmined.org) and join the channel #courses!

<br>

  </a>
</div>

<br>

For more help from the community as you work through these materials, [**check out our other Slack channels above**](#step-1-join-slack). You can ask for help in the **#beginners** or **#support** channels, or the specific channel related to the area you're working on (e.g. #federated-learning or #natural-language-processing), and join the _**#introductions**_ channel for more helpful resources!

<br><br><br>

## Learning

### Step 4: Introductory Videos
A good way to get an overview of the technology OpenMined uses, is to watch one of [Andrew Trask](https://github.com/iamtrask)'s presentations. Here are two examples, one shorter and one longer, that will give you a good starting point:

- **15 Minutes:** [Privacy Preserving AI - Andrew Trask, OpenMined. | DevCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJBBE_SN90A)<br>
- **1 Hour:** [Privacy Preserving AI (Andrew Trask) | MIT Deep Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=4zrU54VIK6k)

<br>

### Step 5: Take one of our FREE Courses from the Private AI Series

If you're interested in taking a deep dive into these technologies, we have also released a series of **FREE courses called the Private AI Series**! [**Check out the Private AI Series here.**](https://courses.openmined.org/)

#### **Course 1:** **[Our Privacy Opportunity](https://courses.openmined.org/courses/our-privacy-opportunity)**

Privacy infrastructure is changing how information is managed in society. In this course, you'll learn how it creates both opportunity and disruption within nearly every corner of society and how you can join this next great wave of innovation.

[Click here to learn more or start the course](https://courses.openmined.org/courses/our-privacy-opportunity)

#### **Course 2:** **[Foundations of Private Computation](https://courses.openmined.org/courses/foundations-of-private-computation)**

Become a data scientist and statistician capable of studying data you do not own and cannot see. Learn every major privacy-preserving technique to an intermediate level, understand how they work together, and how you can use them to safely study data owned by another organization (such as another university, enterprise, or government) without ever seeing the underlying data yourself.
